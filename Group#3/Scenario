Azure Cloud Migration Scenario
Scenario Overview: A company, MediaStream Corp, currently operates an on-premises infrastructure consisting of a database that stores user information and credentials, along with a .NET application that hosts and stores user-generated video content. The company plans to migrate this infrastructure to Azure in order to take advantage of cloud scalability, reliability, and monitoring capabilities.
Your task as an Azure Administrator is to design and demonstrate how to migrate both the on-premises database and the .NET application to Azure. The company also requires active monitoring of their new cloud environment, with alerts set up to notify administrators whenever CPU or memory usage exceeds 50%.
Goals:
Cloud Migration: Plan and demonstrate the migration of the on-premises database and .NET application to Azure, ensuring minimal downtime and a seamless transition.
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring for both the database and the application in Azure, ensuring key performance indicators such as CPU and memory usage are actively monitored.
Alerting on High Resource Usage: Configure alerts that notify administrators whenever CPU or memory usage exceeds 50%, allowing proactive management of the system’s performance.
Student Notes:
Migration Strategy: Design a migration plan to move the on-premises database and .NET application to Azure. You must decide how to approach the migration, which Azure services to use, and how to ensure minimal disruption to the application’s functionality during the transition.
Database Migration: You will need to select the appropriate Azure database service that supports the migration of the company’s user information and credentials, ensuring that the database is secure and scalable in the cloud.
Application Migration: For the .NET application that stores and serves user-generated videos, decide on the most efficient way to host this application in Azure. Ensure that the solution can scale to handle increased video storage and traffic as needed.
Monitoring Solution: Set up monitoring for both the application and the database. Your monitoring solution should track performance metrics such as CPU and memory usage, network activity, and storage utilization.
Alerts: Demonstrate how to configure alerts in Azure that will notify the company when CPU or memory usage exceeds 50% for either the application or the database. Alerts should be sent through email, SMS, or other communication channels as per the company’s preferences.
 
Important Note:
Please exclude Azure WAF (Web Application Firewall) and Azure Firewall from your security and architectural design for now. These can be postponed and should not be included in your initial implementation.
 
Important Considerations:
Minimal Downtime: During the migration, ensure that downtime is minimized, and that there is a contingency plan for any migration challenges.
Security: Ensure that sensitive user information and credentials in the database are securely migrated and protected in the Azure environment. Pay attention to encryption, access control, and compliance with data privacy regulations.
Performance Monitoring: Implement a robust monitoring solution to track the performance of the cloud-based database and application, and ensure that alerts are configured to allow timely intervention if performance degrades.
Cost Management: Consider the costs associated with hosting both the database and the application in Azure. Ensure that the migration plan optimizes resource usage to avoid unnecessary expenses.
Expectations:
Migration Design: Students are expected to design a clear and effective migration strategy, selecting the best Azure services and tools for the database and .NET application migration. The solution must ensure data integrity and availability during the migration process.
Monitoring Setup: Demonstrate how to set up active monitoring for the database and application in Azure. Key performance metrics should be tracked and displayed in an easily accessible dashboard.
Alert Configuration: Configure alerts to notify administrators when CPU or memory usage exceeds 50%. Students should show how the alerting mechanism works and test it to ensure it functions correctly.
Scalability: The solution should be scalable, allowing the company to grow its database and application as user traffic and video needs increase.
In this scenario, students will demonstrate their ability to plan and execute a migration from on-premises to Azure, while also setting up effective monitoring and alerting to ensure optimal performance in the cloud.
